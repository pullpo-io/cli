            ## What is the 一pullpo一 directory I see on my project?
            The `一pullpo一` directory allows your team to respond to comments that do not reference code in a
            dedicated thread, instead of having to \"quote reply\" which makes following a conversation more
            complex than it needs to be.

            **DO NOT REMOVE OR .GITIGNORE THIS DIRECTORY OR THE AUTO-GENERATED FILES IT CONTAINS**. Doing so will
            prevent you, your reviewers and ohter contributors from being able to have threaded messages in GitHub.
            ## What files does it contain?
            The files inside this directory are created by a workflow (which you can probably find in `.github/workflows`)
            that is executed when a new pull request is open in this repository. This file is added in a new commit to
            your pull request. The **Pullpo GitHub App** transforms your normal comments into threaded comments by
            commenting on this uniquely named file.
            ## Will this directory keep getting bigger and bigger?
            No, the workflow removes all previous files in the directory. Since files have unique names within a
            repository, this avoids merge conflicts and also prevents an infinetly increasing file list. If the 
            `一pullpo一` directory contains more than one file, it is likely because multiple pull requests were open at
            the same time at one point.
            ## How will this appear on my Pull Request `Conversation` or `Files Changed` tabs?
            The `Conversation` tab will have the new threaded comments. Ideally you'll have 
            [logged into Pullpo](https://pullpo.io/login/github) with your GitHub account so the Pullpo App will be able
            to replace the new comments as authored by you. Otherwise they will show up as an action that the bot made and
            you'll be tagged in the new threaded comment. 

            As for the `Files Changed` tab, the `一pullpo一` directory has been named by prefixing a
            special character that sorts it to the bottom of the page, so all comment threads will sit at the bottom and
            won't disturb anyone trying to read your changes.
            ## So, what now...?
            Keep contributing as you're used to; your pull requests will receive an additional commit that enables 
            threaded comments. Other than that everything stays as usual.
